Power BI Steps:

# Data Set upload: Go to get data ---> Choose the Data set D:\Elevate Labs\HR Analytics - Predict Employee Attrition\Data set 
--> Transform data if need to add any columns or load the cleaned data. 

Phase 1: Adding Conditional Column

Go to Home → Transform Data (Power Query Editor).
Click Add Column → Conditional Column.
Configure:
New column name: Attrition_Count
Column name: Attrition
Operator: equals
Value: "Yes"
Output: 1
Else: 0
Click OK.

Created a helper column Attrition_Count in Power Query using conditional logic (Yes = 1, No = 0) to enable attrition rate calculations and KPI analysis.

Phase 2: Key Metrics (DAX Measures) in Power BI:

Step 1: Create a Measures Table
Create New Table (for organizing measures)
Go to Modeling → New Table and write:
_Measures = { "Key Metrics" }

After creating it:
Hide the column.
Create all measures inside this _Measures table.

Created a dedicated _Measures table to centrally manage all KPI DAX measures for better dashboard organization and model clarity.

Step 2: Create DAX Measures
Go to Modeling → New Measure and create the following:

1️⃣ Total Employees
Total Employees = COUNTROWS('Table')

Project Note:
Calculated total employee count using COUNTROWS to determine overall workforce size.

2️⃣ Attrition Count
Attrition Count =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Employees],
    'Table'[Attrition] = "Yes"
)

Project Note:
Computed total attrition cases using CALCULATE with filter condition (Attrition = "Yes").

3️⃣ Attrition Rate (%)
Attrition Rate =
DIVIDE(
    [Attrition Count],
    [Total Employees],
    0
)

After creating:
Change format → Percentage.

Project Note:
Derived attrition rate by dividing attrition count by total employees using DIVIDE for safe error handling.

4️⃣ Average Tenure
Avg Tenure = AVERAGE('Table'[YearsAtCompany])

Project Note:
Calculated average employee tenure using AVERAGE function on YearsAtCompany column.

Go to Modeling → New Measure and write:
Active Employees = [Total Employees] - [Attrition Count]

Project Note:
Calculated Active Employees by subtracting attrition count from total employees to represent the current workforce strength for KPI monitoring.

Why This Structure Is Important.

COUNTROWS → Base workforce metric
CALCULATE → Applies filter context
DIVIDE → Prevents divide-by-zero errors
Measures table → Best practice for clean data modeling

Phase 3: Dashboard Layout & Visualizations

Step 1:  KPI Cards: 

Use Multi-row cards or individual Cards for:
Total Employees (1,480)
Attrition Rate (16.08%)
Active Employees (1,242)
Avg Monthly Income (\approx \$6,500)

Step 2: Key Attrition Factors (Visuals):

Attrition by Department (Stacked Bar Chart):
Visual Type: Stacked Bar Chart
Axis (Y-Axis): Department
Values (X-Axis): Attrition Count (measure)
Legend: Attrition (Yes / No)

Project Note
Insight:      Department-wise         Attrition Rate
              Department	            Attrition Rate
              Sales	                  20.67% 🔺 Highest
              Human Resources        	19.05%
              Research & Development	13.75%
Designed a stacked bar chart to compare department-wise attrition distribution, enabling identification of high-turnover departments and workforce stability patterns.
The Sales department recorded the highest attrition rate (20.67%), exceeding the company average (16.19%), indicating a potential need for targeted retention and engagement strategies in Sales.
Sales Department (20.67%) has the highest attrition rate.

Impact of Overtime (Donut Chart):
Legend: OverTime
Values: Attrition Rate

Insight: 
OverTime - Yes: Employees who work overtime represent 74.72% of the total population in the dataset, and their attrition rate is 30.62%.
OverTime - No: Employees who do not work overtime represent 25.28% of the total population, and their attrition rate is 10.36%.

Attrition by Age Group (Clustered Column Chart):
Axis: AgeGroup (18-25, 26-35, etc.)
Values: Attrition Rate

Insight: Age Group of 18-25 are the highest Attrition rate of nearly 42%,  26-35 has 25.33% Attrition rate. 

Monthly Income vs. Attrition (Scatter Plot):
X-Axis: MonthlyIncome
Y-Axis: Age
Color: Attrition

Insight: The company’s attrition rate stands at 16.19%, with Sales showing the highest attrition (20.67%). Attrition is significantly higher among younger employees earning lower monthly income, highlighting compensation and early-career engagement as critical areas for retention strategy improvement.

3. Employee Satisfaction & Environment

Satisfaction Heatmap (Matrix):
Rows: JobRole
Columns: JobSatisfaction (Low to Very High)
Values: Attrition Rate
Formatting: Use Conditional Formatting (Red for high attrition, Green for low).

The Satisfaction Heatmap reveals a strong inverse relationship between job satisfaction and attrition rate. Attrition is highest among employees with low job satisfaction, particularly in Sales-related roles. Improving engagement, recognition, and career growth opportunities in these roles can significantly reduce turnover risk.

Tenure Analysis (Line Chart):
Axis: YearsAtCompany
Values: Attrition Count
Insight: Discover the "Peak Departure Year" (often year 1 or 2).
