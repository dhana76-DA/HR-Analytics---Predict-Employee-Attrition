IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-and-Performance-Prediction


# HR ANALYTICS
HR analytics is the process of collecting and analyzing Human Resource (HR) data in order to improve an organization’s workforce performance. The process can also be referred to as talent analytics, people analytics, or even workforce analytics. This method of data analysis takes data that is routinely collected by HR and correlates it to HR and organizational objectives. Doing so provides measured evidence of how HR initiatives are contributing to the organization’s goals and strategies.

# OBJECTIVE
Employee attrition is the rate at which employees leave a company. The goal of this analysis is to model employee attrition and determine the most dominant contributing factors that govern this turnover. Through this kind of analysis, we can understand how many employees are likely to leave, while also determining which employees are at the highest risk and for what reasons.

# MOTIVATION
The project stems from the potential to improve employee satisfaction, reduce costs, enhance organizational performance, and create a positive workplace culture. It's an opportunity to use data and analytics to make meaningful changes that benefit both employees and the organization as a whole.

# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
System Architecture
The methodology for IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-and-Performance-Prediction is as follows:-
- Load the Dataset: The IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset is loaded using the pd.read_csv() function. The head() and info() methods are used to display the first few rows and get information about the dataset, respectively.
- Knowing the Dataset: Basic Information about the dataset is generated; numerical and categorical attributes are enlisted.
- Data Cleaning: Any missing values in the dataset are dropped using the dropna() method.
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used to visualize the data. 
- Statistical Analysis: The ANOVA Test is performed to analyze the Numerical Features' Importance in Employee Attrition, while the Chi-Square Test to Analyze the Categorical Feature Importance in Employee Attrition.
- Data Preprocessing: The target variable 'Attrition' is mapped to binary values (1 for 'Yes' and 0 for 'No'). Selected features are extracted from the dataset and one-hot encoded using the get_dummies() function.
- Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() method from scikit-learn.
- Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers are initialized and trained using the training data.
- Model Evaluation: The accuracy score and confusion matrix are computed to evaluate the performance of each algorithm on the testing data.
- Results: The results, including the accuracy and confusion matrix, are printed for each algorithm.
- Model Performance Comparison: The hvPlot library is used to visualize the ROC curve diagram comparing the performance of all models used.

# DATASET
This is a hypothetical dataset created by IBM data scientists. The dataset has (1470R X 35C) that contains numeric and categorical data types describing each employee’s background and characteristics, and labeled with whether they are still in the company or whether they have gone to work somewhere else.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset, from data loading to model evaluation. By implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, we gained insights into which models are effective for predicting employee attrition. The results and visualizations generated throughout the process provide valuable information for decision-makers and HR professionals seeking to understand and mitigate employee attrition within the organization. This project showcases the power of data analysis and machine learning in addressing real-world business challenges.

# Reason for the attrition
Feature Importance Interpretation
JobLevel 0.199 Primary Predictor. Attrition is tied to the employee's rank/seniority.
OverTime 0.154 Work-Life Balance. Burnout is a major cause of resignation.
MonthlyIncome 0.067 Financial. While important, it is actually less influential than JobLevel and OverTime in this specific model.
Promotion Gap 0.047 Growth. Stagnation contributes but is a secondary factor compared to the daily grind (Overtime).

# Data Analysis Key Findings
The attrition rate for the 'Human Resources' department is 19.05%.
The attrition rate for the 'Research & Development' department is 13.75%.
'Human Resources' exhibits a higher attrition rate (19.05%) compared to 'Research & Development' (13.75%).

# Insights or Next Steps
Further investigation is recommended to understand the underlying causes of the higher attrition rate in the 'Human Resources' department.
Consider conducting an in-depth analysis of factors such as workload, compensation, career development opportunities, and employee satisfaction specific to the 'Human Resources' department to inform targeted retention strategies.
